Palindrome Finder using Reverse-and-Add Method
📌 Description

This Python program takes a number as input and repeatedly applies the Reverse-and-Add process to check if it becomes a palindrome.

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when reversed (e.g., 121, 1331).

🔄 Reverse-and-Add Process:

Take the given number.

Reverse its digits.

Add the reversed number to the original number.

Repeat until a palindrome is found, or until a given limit of steps.

📝 How It Works

The user enters:

A starting number (a).

A maximum limit of steps (limit).

In each step:

The number is reversed.

It is added to the original number.

The result is checked for palindrome.

If a palindrome is found → the program stops and displays it.

If the limit is reached without finding a palindrome → the program ends.

CODE :

Enter The Number: 89
Enter The Limit: 10
step 1 = 187
step 2 = 968
step 3 = 1837
step 4 = 9218
step 5 = 17347
step 6 = 91718
step 7 = 173437
step 8 = 907808
Found Paliandrome:  907808
